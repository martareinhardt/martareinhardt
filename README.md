# 🌌 Marta Reinhardt

👋 Hello! I'm a researcher and lifelong observer of the cosmos.  
My curiosity moves across disciplines — from **physics and cosmology** to **mathematics, and data science** — guided by a single question:

> **How can we truly understand the Universe in all its dimensions?**

I have no professional ambitions in the traditional sense;  
my purpose is **scientific, collaborative, and humanistic** —  
to explore, connect, and share knowledge openly.
